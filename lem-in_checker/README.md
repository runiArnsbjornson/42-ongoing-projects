Welcome,

This is the checker I have done in order to make tests easy to run on the lem-in project. It's a project of 42. Please don't use it to correct anyone if you don't have look after each test and be sure that you know what you are testing. If someone try to correct you with these test without knowing this, please lockscreen.

**********************************************************************

USE lem-in-check like this :

**sh lem-in-check.sh**

**********************************************************************

Before using it, enter the full pathname of the directory where your lemin is on the LEM_IN_DIR variable, between the simple quote, like this : (it's the line 4 on the lem-in-check.sh)
LEM_IN_DIR='/my/dir/lemin'

Every contribution is welcome.
And every correction on my poor english.
